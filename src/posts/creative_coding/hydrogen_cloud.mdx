In the solution to the Schrödinger equation, which is non-relativistic,
hydrogen-like atomic orbitals are eigenfunctions of
the one-electron angular momentum operator <InlineMath math="L" />
and its <InlineMath math="z" /> component <InlineMath math="L_z" />​.
A hydrogen-like atomic orbital is uniquely identified by
the values of the principal quantum number <InlineMath math="n" />,
the angular momentum quantum number <InlineMath math="l" />,
and the magnetic quantum number <InlineMath math="m_l" />.
