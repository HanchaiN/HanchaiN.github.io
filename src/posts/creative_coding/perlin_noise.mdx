Perlin noise is a type of gradient noise developed by Ken Perlin in 1983.
It has many uses, including but not limited to:
procedurally generating terrain, applying pseudo-random changes to a variable,
and assisting in the creation of image textures.
It is most commonly implemented in two, three, or four dimensions,
but can be defined for any number of dimensions.
