block page_description
  p.
    In the solution to the Schrödinger equation, which is non-relativistic,
    hydrogen-like atomic orbitals are eigenfunctions of
    the one-electron angular momentum operator \(L\)
    and its \(z\) component \(L_z\)​.
    A hydrogen-like atomic orbital is uniquely identified by
    the values of the principal quantum number \(n\),
    the angular momentum quantum number \(l\),
    and the magnetic quantum number \(m_l\).
  p.
    <strong>How to interact:</strong> The visualization renders a 3D probability cloud using ray marching.
    The foreground canvas is interactive - you can rotate the view to see the orbital from different angles.

    <strong>What you're seeing:</strong>
  ul
    li Brighter regions show higher probability of finding the electron
    li The shape is determined by quantum numbers n, l, and m
    li Different orbitals (s, p, d, f) have distinct shapes
    li The visualization solves the Schrödinger equation for the hydrogen atom
  p.
    These quantum mechanical wavefunctions are the foundation of chemistry -
    they determine how atoms bond and interact with each other.
