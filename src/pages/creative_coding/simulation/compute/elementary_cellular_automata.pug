block page_description
  p.
    In mathematics and computability theory, an elementary cellular automaton is a one-dimensional cellular automaton where there are two possible states (labeled 0 and 1) and the rule to determine the state of a cell in the next generation depends only on the current state of the cell and its two immediate neighbors.
  p.
    <strong>How to interact:</strong> Watch as simple rules create complex patterns. Each row shows one generation,
    with time flowing downward. The pattern starts from a single cell at the top.
  p.
    <strong>Rule numbers:</strong> Elementary cellular automata are numbered 0-255 based on their behavior.
    Different rules produce wildly different patterns:
  ul
    li <strong>Rule 30:</strong> Chaotic, used for random number generation
    li <strong>Rule 90:</strong> Creates Sierpiński triangles
    li <strong>Rule 110:</strong> Turing complete (can compute anything!)
    li <strong>Rule 184:</strong> Models traffic flow
  p.
    These simple systems demonstrate how complex behavior emerges from simple local rules,
    relevant to physics, biology, and computer science.
