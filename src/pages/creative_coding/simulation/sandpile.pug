block page_description
  p.
    The Abelian sandpile model (ASM) is the more popular name of the original Bak–Tang–Wiesenfeld model (BTW). The BTW model was the first discovered example of a dynamical system displaying self-organized criticality.
  p.
    <strong>How it works:</strong> Grains of sand are added one at a time to a grid.
    When a pile becomes too high (≥4 grains), it topples, distributing grains to neighboring cells.
    This can trigger avalanches that cascade across the grid.
  p.
    <strong>Self-organized criticality:</strong> Without external tuning, the system naturally evolves to a critical state
    where avalanches of all sizes occur, following a power-law distribution. This behavior appears in many natural phenomena:
    earthquakes, forest fires, stock market crashes, and neural activity.
