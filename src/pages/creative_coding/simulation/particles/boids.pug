block page_description
  p.
    Boids is an artificial life program,
    developed by Craig Reynolds in 1986,
    which simulates the flocking behaviour of birds.
  p.
    <strong>How it works:</strong> Each boid (bird-like object) follows three simple rules:
  ul
    li <strong>Separation:</strong> Avoid crowding nearby boids
    li <strong>Alignment:</strong> Steer towards the average heading of nearby boids
    li <strong>Cohesion:</strong> Move towards the average position of nearby boids
  p.
    Watch as these simple rules create complex, life-like flocking patterns. The colored dots represent individual boids,
    and the wedge shape shows each boid's vision cone and detection range.
