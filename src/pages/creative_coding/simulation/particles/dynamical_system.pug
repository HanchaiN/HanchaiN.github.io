block page_description
  p.
    In physics, a dynamical system is described as a "particle or ensemble of particles whose state varies over time and thus obeys differential equations involving time derivatives".
  p.
    <strong>What you're seeing:</strong> Particles following deterministic equations of motion,
    creating intricate trajectories based on their initial conditions and the forces acting on them.
  p.
    This visualization demonstrates chaos theory - how small changes in initial conditions
    can lead to vastly different outcomes. The system may be deterministic, but it's often unpredictable.
