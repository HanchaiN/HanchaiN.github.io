  p.
    The path integral formulation is a description in quantum mechanics that generalizes the action principle of classical mechanics. It replaces the classical notion of a single, unique classical trajectory for a system with a sum, or functional integral, over an infinity of quantum-mechanically possible trajectories to compute a quantum amplitude.

    <strong>What you're seeing:</strong> A visualization of the double-slit experiment using Feynman's path integral approach.
    Instead of particles taking a single path, quantum mechanics considers all possible paths simultaneously.
  p.
    <strong>Key concepts:</strong>
  ul
    li Each possible path contributes to the final probability
    li Paths interfere with each other, creating the interference pattern
    li This explains wave-particle duality and quantum behavior
  p.
    The simulation shows how considering all paths - even seemingly absurd ones - leads to the correct quantum mechanical predictions.
    This is the foundation of quantum field theory and modern physics.
