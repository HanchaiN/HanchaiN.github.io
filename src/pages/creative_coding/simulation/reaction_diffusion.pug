  p.
    Reaction–diffusion systems are mathematical models which correspond to several physical phenomena. The most common is the change in space and time of the concentration of one or more chemical substances: local chemical reactions in which the substances are transformed into each other, and diffusion which causes the substances to spread out over a surface in space.
  p.
    <strong>How it works:</strong> Two virtual chemicals (labeled A and B) interact:
  ul
    li Chemical A is continuously added to the system
    li Chemical B is removed at a constant rate
    li When A and B meet, A converts into B (the reaction)
    li Both chemicals spread out over time (diffusion)
  p.
    Watch as these simple rules create complex, organic patterns resembling:
    coral growth, zebra stripes, leopard spots, and other natural formations.
    The patterns emerge from the delicate balance between reaction rates and diffusion speeds.
