block page_description
  p.
    A random dungeon is a dungeon in a role-playing video game which is procedurally generated by the computer using an algorithm, such that the dungeon is laid out differently every time the player enters it, and a player often never plays through quite the same dungeon twice, as there are innumerable possibilities for how they generate.
  p.
    <strong>How to interact:</strong> Click the canvas to generate a new dungeon layout.
    The visualization shows the generation process in real-time:
  ul
    li <strong>Dark areas</strong> represent walls and solid rock
    li <strong>Lighter areas</strong> show rooms and walkable spaces
    li <strong>Corridors</strong> connect rooms together
    li <strong>Colored highlights</strong> show the pathfinding algorithm at work
  p.
    The algorithm uses a combination of BSP (Binary Space Partitioning) tree subdivision
    and graph-based pathfinding to ensure all rooms are accessible.
