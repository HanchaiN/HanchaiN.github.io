block page_description
  p.
    The Hilbert curve (also known as the Hilbert space-filling curve) is a continuous fractal space-filling curve first described by the German mathematician David Hilbert in 1891, as a variant of the space-filling Peano curves discovered by Giuseppe Peano in 1890.
  p.
    <strong>What you're seeing:</strong> Watch the curve recursively subdivide the square,
    creating a pattern that visits every pixel exactly once without crossing itself.
  p.
    <strong>Applications:</strong> Data locality (mapping 2D to 1D for better cache performance),
    database indexing (spatial data structures), image processing (dithering algorithms),
    and TSP optimization (traveling salesman problem heuristics).
  p.
    The curve maintains locality - points close on the curve are close in 2D space.
