block page_description
  p.
    Perlin noise is a type of gradient noise developed by Ken Perlin in 1983.
    It has many uses, including but not limited to:
    procedurally generating terrain, applying pseudo-random changes to a variable,
    and assisting in the creation of image textures.
    It is most commonly implemented in two, three, or four dimensions,
    but can be defined for any number of dimensions.

    <strong>How to interact:</strong> Click the canvas to generate a new random noise pattern.
    Each pattern is created using coherent noise that produces organic, flowing shapes.
  p.
    <strong>Applications:</strong>
  ul
    li Terrain height maps for landscapes and mountains
    li Cloud and fog textures
    li Procedural wood and marble patterns
    li Natural-looking randomness in games and animations
  p.
    Unlike pure random noise, Perlin noise creates smooth transitions between values,
    making it ideal for natural phenomena simulation.
