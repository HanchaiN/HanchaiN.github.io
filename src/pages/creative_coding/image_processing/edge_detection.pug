block page_description
  p.
    Edge detection includes a variety of mathematical methods that aim at identifying edges,
    defined as curves in a digital image at which the image brightness changes sharply
    or, more formally, has discontinuities.
  p.
    <strong>How to use:</strong> Upload an image to see edge detection applied in real-time.
  p.
    <strong>How it works:</strong> The algorithm detects sharp changes in brightness by computing gradients.
    Common techniques include:
  ul
    li <strong>Sobel operator:</strong> Convolves the image with edge-detection kernels
    li <strong>Canny edge detector:</strong> Multi-stage algorithm with noise reduction
    li <strong>Gradient magnitude:</strong> Measures the strength of brightness changes
  p.
    Edge detection is fundamental to computer vision, used in object recognition, image segmentation,
    medical imaging, and autonomous vehicles. Edges reveal the structure and boundaries of objects in a scene.
